# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm marisian.

I'm a **data scientist & researcher** currently focused on the application of NLP to labor market topics. Before focusing on NLP, I worked extensively in data analysis and warehousing in banking and finance organizations. My projects demonstrate not only advanced modeling but also end-to-end pipelines, from raw data ingestion to warehouse modeling and analysis.

My areas of interest and expertise are:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Visualization
- CI/CD & Production-Ready Data Pipelines
- Applied Data Science in labor markets, social data, and text analysis
